# LOTR Lookalike

This Hugging Face Space allows you to **upload a photo** of a face and find the closest **Lord of the Rings character lookalike** from our gallery.  

The gallery images are loaded dynamically from the `optimized_gallery` folder, so the repository **does not track large image files**. Please upload them via the Space's **Files and versions** tab if running locally.  

## Features

- Upload a face or character image.
- Get top lookalike characters from LOTR.
- Fast and interactive web app using **Gradio**.
